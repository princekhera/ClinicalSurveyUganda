# ClinicalSurveyUganda# 📋 Clinical Nurse Measurements Survey Form – KoboToolbox Project

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a preparatory data collection drive for a cohort study of patients in Uganda. The objective was to convert a paper-based clinical measurement form into a digital survey using [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/), a popular open-source data collection platform.

The output is an `.xlsx` form that can be uploaded and deployed via KoboToolbox to enable digital data collection in the field using mobile devices.
